# Transcendent Engine

## About

Transcendent Engine Application Engine is a C++ based Application engine that can be used to develop 2D applications anywhere from video games to office utility applications.

## About me

I am a school student who is interested in programming. I made this engine as a learning project. The development has taught me a lot regarding source control, graphics programming and even logic in the importance of the order of functions.

## The future

I plan on updating this repository for as long as possible, continuously adding features to help make the engine as good as possible.
